					<description><![CDATA[My colleague Håkan Forss wrote something on his blog I think highlights that the Japanese understanding of Kata is about going deeper than behavior:

&quot;A Kata is something that you practice over and over striving for perfection. In the book “Managing Flow”, Ikujiro Nonaka describes Kata as a traditional Japanese code of knowledge that describes a process of synthesizing thought and behavior in skillful action; the metacognition of reflection in action. If the Kata itself is relative static, the content of the Kata, as we execute it is modified based on the situation and context in real-time as it happens. Nonaka also describes Kata as different from a routine in that it contains a continuous self-renewal process.&quot;

The original intent of Kata seems in my view to incorporate self-transformation on a pretty deep level, similar to what I propose above.]]></description>
