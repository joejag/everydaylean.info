					<description><![CDATA[@Oleberg

Thanks for the comment and the insight from your context.

I think you&#039;re right - the thing is complexity rather than raw size. However, when you increase size, and you hit the effective size limit of a team (usually by 10), you start thinking about 2 teams. So now you have a communication issue, which begins the complexity.

It is also designed for people new to Agile, so the practises are simple and relatively easily taught.

Deep experts like Ron will of course understand that there are advanced practises that are highly powerful, but often miss that they&#039;re challenging for organisations and individuals already struggling with a leap to basic Agile thinking and ways: anything on top of that has to address specific needs or it&#039;s just going to get crowded out in the struggle for learning bandwidth.

Leaving to one side the practises, SAFe&#039;s way of describing things is designed to be an easier sell to skeptical management types: there&#039;s a focus on business benefit and &#039;better&#039; and a little less of the revolutionary rhetoric. If your first Agile transformation message is &quot;shoot all the Managers,&quot; you shouldn&#039;t be surprised if the existing power structures block you, and you find yourself sitting out on the street, wondering what just happened.

So there *is* an element of SAFe which is marketing ploy. But if is more successful in convincing skeptical management to move away from waterfall where previous attempts have failed for over a decade, how is that A Bad Thing?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[IME it is sufficient that it is enough if there is a need to deliver things bigger than a single Agile team could handle in a business-acceptable timescale, in order to justify practises needed for scalability. Scaling here refers to complexity, not size.

Your remarks that many of the SAFe practises are needed if the organisation is somewhat reluctant to certain practises, is an interesting one.

Currently working in three larger scale transformations, where two is pro-agile on a management level, and the third is not really. Where SAFe is considered? In the two pro-agile organisations... :-)]]></description>
