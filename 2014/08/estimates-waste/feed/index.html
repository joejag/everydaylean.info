					<description><![CDATA[Good point on separating the &quot;runners&quot; from the specials: in fact I think you are on to somethong. In separating the runners from the specials we are in fact separating the planning of the work (project management) from the execution of the work, which I  practice segregated the risk (specials) outside the normal day to day execution of the work.
In high variability work like software this segregation is immensely valuable! 

Thanks for sparking this thought! :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Continuing on our twitter discussion.
I stated I like the idea of thinking: &quot;If we quit/stop after next iteration, what will it look like then?&quot;

But I sense different &quot;levels&quot; of estimates here. One is the &quot;all-in&quot; thinking. And another is &quot;what&#039;s next?&quot;. My tweet you&#039;re mentioning in the original post above is aimed towards: &quot;What&#039;s next assumption to test?&quot; i.e the learning we seek.

But it seems to me we still need some judgment about &quot;how long does it take to build something so we can validate our assumption/hypothesy?&quot;

But I&#039;d rather like to estimate a two week (or two month or other &quot;smallish&quot;) experiment than an &quot;all-in&quot; 8 month project. And maybe focus on how experiment can be as small as possible (like slicing or maybe better cut waste from being built - i.e doesn&#039;t contribute to the learning we seek)?

And I&#039;m thinking that if it&#039;s possible to cut down building an experiment to test an assumption to just a day or couple of days; estimates aren&#039;t really needed..?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Something that occurs to me about the slicing to &quot;small enough&quot; (separating off the TFB things for further slicing) and then counting method is that it&#039;s exactly what you&#039;d do on a Lean Manufacturing system: separate off your runners from your specials and then operate fast flow on the runners.

That way, the specials don&#039;t clog up the runner flow (high variation makes the utilisation/delay curve much worse, per Reinertsen).

When I proposed this in about 2008, people told me I was mad, because software cannot and should not behave that way...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Vasco

Thanks for your feedback, here and on Twitter


To respond to your challenges (and I&#039;m happy that I might be wrong in this!):

&lt;q style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;estimation always reduces uncertainty&lt;/q&gt;
By going through the process, you know more than you did before, even if it&#039;s a better understanding of how much uncertainty is involved.

Now that doesn&#039;t mean that the estimate is right, but before the estimate, your range of uncertainty is zero to infinity. Afterward, it might be within an order of magnitude (or two). It might be as simple a categorisation as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pawelbrodzinski/status/493730902241861633&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pawel Brodzinski&#039;s scale&lt;/a&gt;. 

&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BttgjJEIIAAcrvC.jpg&quot; /&gt;

But that&#039;s less uncertainty than we started with.

Also, note that we&#039;re not just talking about cost, but all delivery constraints.

&lt;q style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;estimation is always useful&lt;/q&gt;
I completely agree that there is a risk of negative outcomes. But reducing uncertainty is always useful in and of itself. Now, how do we reduce the risk of negative outcomes?

&lt;q style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Story point estimating is not quick&lt;/q&gt;
As you say, it&#039;s relatively quick, but it depends on where you start. This should always be a direction towards &#039;better&#039;, rather than a static entry criterion. &#039;Good enough&#039; should always be ahead of us.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good post! 
I especially like the point that you make about estimation being &quot;valuable enough?&quot;.
That indeed is a very critical question that often remains unexamined. 

However, you seem to take as granted the following: 
- estimation always reduces uncertainty (from: &quot;reduce the uncertainty around the risk that the work will cost more than it’s worth&quot;). This is not always the case, and in fact we see that many projects - that were estimated - end up costing a lot more than estimated (which is not always a bad thing, mind you). 
- estimation is always useful (from: “but they’re all more useful than not doing them.”). In this post you do not consider at all the negative consequences of estimation - namely things like goal displacement and political pressures that come with estimates created very early in the project that end up defining the actions we take later on - even if reality is at that point different.

I also agree that “quick” estimation practices are valuable. However, it is not my experience that Story Point estimation is quick (although it is *relatively* quicker than some other options). In fact Ken Power presented some years ago a technique for Story Point estimation called “Silent grouping”, where they could estimate several hundred stories in a few hours. We would not need techniques like these if story point estimation was inherently quick. 

I’d love to read/hear more from you regarding these quick estimation practices. I believe that those are better alternatives to the current accepted practices in project estimation. Namely Blink estimates or the slicing heuristic that @neilkillick wrote about in his blog. 

Thanks for sharing your ideas. Would be great to continue this conversation in a more interactive form in a conference near you! :)]]></description>
