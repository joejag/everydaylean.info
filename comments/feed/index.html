					<description><![CDATA[&lt;h3&gt;PostScript:&lt;/h3&gt;

The exam is pretty tough, and while it is an online multiple choice affair, it is mostly based on situational scenarios that require &lt;em&gt;judgement&lt;/em&gt; from the candidate, not merely testing &lt;em&gt;memory&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p class=&quot;lede&quot;&gt;This is A Good Thing.&lt;/p&gt;

The main exceptions are questions clearly added for new elements of v4.6 of the framework that don&#039;t relate to the RTE role at all. These feel like they have been added into all the exams in their 4.6 revs. Fair enough for the introductory classes, but not for this which is a deeper one.]]></description>
