					<description><![CDATA[I am happy to see someone actually break with orthodoxy and actually speak what most of my customers are living through right now.  Nor do I personally believe that every application should be developed in an Agile mode.  Kaizan-style continuous improvement often has some value, but too many people are conflating Agile and Lean and get it wrong (or get scared by Big bang change).

It doesn&#039;t help that so many organizations are developing Lean operations but insist on calling it something else (corporate America values leaders/innovators/plagiarizers, not followers).
